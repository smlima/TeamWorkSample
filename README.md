The purpose of this little repo is to demonstrate a valid usage of the Teamwork APIs
and to create and organize the Android Source code following the SOLID principles (as much as possible
due to time ).

Architecture of the app : follows the MVVM principle using the databinding support from Android
each component has its own viewmodel, component, and view(fragment) associated, and whenever a new component
is created each of those classes must be created, unless if using common shared components (ie. Lists)

UI : its a 70's vintage app ;P without much effort put on UI, because the rest of the arch and core components took
more effort/time than expected

Comments (and constructive critics) on source code are always welcomed!! reach out !

Disclaimer:
It was only tested on debug builds and on emulators, therefore using on a real device
 you're on your own ;P it shouldnt have major problems though!
